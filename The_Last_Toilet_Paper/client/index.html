        <h2>The Last Toilet Paper</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Originality:</strong>
                The user will be able to control People to fight for survival during this pandemic.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
                It is very simple. It uses the Phaser 2 game framework and uses keyboard keys.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
                The game that this prototype is based on is called Muddledash.
                This is a casual, indie, racing game where a player must compete with 3 other players and be the first one to take a gift to a party.
                The person who takes the gift there first, wins. There is only one gift and players must fight with each other in order to get the gift.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
                I made the sword sprite from scratch but the man, platform and music are borrowed from different sources.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Woman and Men were borrowed from a sprite store. <a href="https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-3-character-sprite-sheets-pixel-art/">This is the source of the man </a>. It is obtained by clicking on the "Download this zip file" link.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The platforms were borrowed from the introductory tutorial from Phaser's website. <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">This is the source of the platform </a>. It is obtained by clicking on the "Download this zip file" link.

                <strong>High Concept:</strong>
                Be the first one to keep the Toilet Paper Roll the longest.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Prototype Goal</strong></li>
            The prototype is evaluating basic player movement in the 4 cardinal directions and accuracy is throwing an attack on the other player.

            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals: </strong></li>
            When the user plays this game, they should feel a sense of competitiveness and adrenaline.

            <li><strong>Gameplay: </strong>
            <li>
                The actions the player can take is moving the people using the arrow keys or WASD keys and the space bar or ESC key to attack another person.
                You will also be able to protect the TP using power ups.
                This prototype will also be experimenting the use of touch screen input as a method to move and attack another player.

            <li><strong>Strategies: </strong></li>
            Timing the kick and creating a random pattern of movement so you do not seem predictable.
