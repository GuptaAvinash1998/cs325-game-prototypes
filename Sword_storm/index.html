<h2>SWORD STORM</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
You get to dodge falling swords with UNLIMITED LIVES!!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
It is very simple. It uses the Phaser 2 game framework and uses only 2 keyboard keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learnt how to make a very simple game using the Phaser 2 javascript framework. I also learnt what prototyping means and why it si very important.
The hardest part was getting used to the functions that the framework provides. Since this is my first game using Phaser 2 it was a challenge trying to implement certain features in the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the sword sprite from scratch but the man, platform and music are borrowed from different sources.
The man was borrowed from the introductory tutorial from Phaser's website. <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">This is the source of the man </a> It is obtained by clicking on the "Download this zip file" link.
The platform was borrowed from the introductory tutorial from Phaser's website. <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">This is the source of the platform </a> It is obtained by clicking on the "Download this zip file" link.
The audio file was borrowed from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Razor5/sounds/448041/">here</a>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game is kind of unique. It is not unique in its genre but there are very few games that are similar to this game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The is about controlling a small man to avoid the falling swords.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I feel themes of this game are fast paced, dark and death.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input used is the keyboard. The user plays the game using only two keys on the keyboard.
The genre is Platform and falling objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Some of the game mechanics that are being evaluated are area movement, instant killing and avoidng killable objects
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should be experience a fast paced environment by the falling swords and progressive music.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay is very simple. The input of the game is using the keybaord. The core mechanic is moving left and right.
player moves left or right by clicking on the left or right arrow key repectively.
Essentailly the full game will include the player having 3 lives or 3 chances and if the player looses all 3 lives, it is game over and restarts the game for another shot.
Over time as the player survives longer, the swords begin to fall a little bit faster to make the game for challenging. Living forever in a game is not fun so this gives the player a challenge to test how fast one's reflexes can be.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A strategy that can be used in playing this game would be to not make your movements extremely random but notice the trends as to which areas of the screen the swords fall more often and avoid those areas.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>

The man you play in the game is a daredevil that has challenged the world that if the world rained swords, he would never die. To prove this, he locks himself in a room with no exists and swords falling from random parts of the ceiling.
The tokens do not mean anything more than a sword ready to kill him.
The tension of proving to the world that you can survive a rainfall of swords lies in the hands of the player controling the man. Given three chances, can you survive??
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Users above the age of 8 can play this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game lasts depending on how good the user is. It could last from a few seconds to forever.
</li>
