		<h2>FARTO MAN</h2>

		<ul>
		<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
		In this game you get to travel through pipes not by flapping your wings, but by thrusting yourself with your fart! AND youo get a power up!
		</li>

		<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
		It uses the Phaser 2 framework and requires only one key to play which is the spacebar key. Much of the time was spent on adding the new features to the game, like the random appearance of the cans, the condition
		needed to activate the power up and the power up itself. Finding the right functions for certain events in the phaser 2 framework can be very challenging as the API documentation is not very detailed and well explained.
		Finding it through the community forums and examples have more deatiled explainations and in case uses which make you understand better. The game contains multiple timers and events that must happen after a certain number of seconds. 
		It also contains functions enable and disable the physics of an sprite to allow certain actions to happen.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
		I learnt how to make different events happen at different times and also how to enable and disable the physics of a sprite.
		The hardest part was finding good documentation for the methods in the Phaser 2 Framework. Due to the lack of good documentation, implemeting the various functions is challenging.
		Finding the community forums is an easier process and very helpful as well. The easiest part was understading what functions were needed to make a certain feature.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
		I made the man and the fart sprites from scratch.
		The pipe was borrowed from the introductory tutorial from Phaser's website. <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">This is the source of the man </a>. It is obtained by clicking on the "Download this zip file" link.
		The Farting was borrowed from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/bankfraudd/sounds/145103/">here </a>.
		The sound for collecting the can of beans was was borrowed from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Robinhood76/sounds/499790/">here</a>.
		The can of beans was borrowed from <a href = "https://www.canstockphoto.com/tin-of-baked-beans-31191860.html">here</a>
		The sound played when you die was broorwed from the GMU sound library.

		<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
		The game that closely resembles my game is Flappy Bird. I borrowed the base of the game from the Flappy Bird tutroial given in piazza.
		</li>

		<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
		The game is about getting as far as you can with your farts.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
		The Storymatic themes used for this game are Farting and Flight. The fact that you jump up and down through farting shows that it has the farting element and
		since you are flying ypur fart through a series of pipes, it has the floght element to it.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
		The input used is the keyboard more specifically the space bar. The position of the holes in the pipes are random and the appearance of the can of beans are random. The actions of the man are not random, so I would say the game
		involves more randomness than being deterministic. The Play styles this game possess are <b>Collector and Achiever</b>. You <b>Collect</b> the can of beans and you <b>Achieve</b> a high score.
		The genres of this game are <b>Side-scroller</b> and <b>Arcade game</b>.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
		The game mechancis in this game are very simple. All the player has to do is constantly fart to fly and fly through the pipes. Collect the can of beans so that you can get a power up.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
		The player should be experiencing a challenging situation as the holes are in random places and the pipes move a little fast.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
		The gameplay is very simple. The input of the game is using the sapcebar. Use the space bar to jump or fart. The core mechanic is moving up and down.
		As the player flies, the world will be moving to the left and the pipes come towards you. There will be a hole bigger than the size of the man and you have to fly through it.
		If you touch the pipe, you die!!.
		As you play, you will notice a sprite that look slike a can of beans. If you collect 2 of those cans, you get an instant power up. The power up is to phase through the pipes for 6 seconds without dying.
		The goal is to get as far as you can without dying.
		Essentially the full game will include keeping track of the player's previous score and setting a high score. This high score can be shared to friends.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
		There are no startegies in this game.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>

		The man you play in the game believed that man kind could fly for free by using the power of their farts!. No one believed that it could be possible for a man to fly with their fart so he set out to prove everyone wrong.
		He figured out how to fly! Now he must travel back to tell the world how to fly through the power of farting!
		The tension of travelling back to show the world that you can fly with your fart lies in the hands of the player controlling the man. Given a series of pipes in the way, can you survive??
		</li>

		<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
		Users above the age of 8 can play this game.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
		The game lasts depending on how good the user is. It could last from a few seconds to forever.
