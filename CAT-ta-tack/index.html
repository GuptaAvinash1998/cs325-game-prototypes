		<h2>FARTO MAN</h2>

		<ul>
		<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
			In this game, you get to protect the main character through the use of drag and using your pointer.
		</li>

		<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
			The development of this game is different and more complex than the previous ones. It contains multiple game states (6 to be exact). Each state inter connected and communicated with each other. The game play relies heavily on the use of the mouse and the movement of the cursor. While you can freely move the cursor around, the main sprite itself will not follow you, so the only way to get the sprite to move around is to use the drag and drop feature. Due to the fact that you are constantly clicking on the main sprite and moving the cursor, the enemy sprite will then follow the cursor and the main sprite you are playing as.

		</li>

		<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
			I learned how to handle events related to the cursor on different types of game objects. I also learned how to connect multiple states and call each one from a different state. I also learned how to efficiently use time events.

			</ul>


			<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
			The game is pretty similar to a game I used to play on Facebook when I was a kid. I forgot the name of the game, but the game was about saving the cursor from a gorilla and rockets.
